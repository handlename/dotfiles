# setup-worktree.sh
#
# Sets up a newly created linked git worktree. Intended to be invoked from a
# `post-checkout` hook, but safe to run manually from any directory. Two
# phases run in order:
#
#   1. Copy — copies untracked files declared in the main worktree's
#      `.worktreeinclude` into the current linked worktree.
#   2. Run  — executes setup scripts declared in the main worktree
#      (`.worktreesetup`), but only when the repository is trusted.
#
# Declarations are read from the main worktree root:
#   - `.worktreeinclude`       — team-shared copy list (usually tracked)
#   - `.worktreeinclude.local` — personal copy additions (untracked)
#   - `.worktreesetup`         — team-shared setup script (usually tracked)
#   - `.worktreesetup.local`   — personal setup script (untracked)
#
# Setup scripts run on every worktree creation (there is no first-run marker),
# so they must be written to be idempotent — e.g. `mise trust`,
# `aqua policy allow`. They run with the worktree root as the working
# directory, after the copy phase, and only when the repository's identity
# (derived from its `origin` remote) matches an entry in the trust allowlist:
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/worktree-setup/trusted
# Entries are `host/org` (org-wide) or `host/org/repo` (single repo), one per
# line; `#` comments and blank lines are ignored. The allowlist lives outside
# any repository, so a cloned repository cannot authorize itself to run code.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Does nothing (exit 0) when: invoked for an ordinary branch switch, not
#     in a git repo, in the main worktree, or the main worktree has no
#     declaration files.
#   - Never overwrites existing files in the worktree.
#   - Copy phase is idempotent: a second run copies nothing new.
#   - Setup scripts run only for allowlisted repositories; when they exist
#     but the repository is untrusted, a notice explains what was skipped and
#     how to opt in. A failing script is reported but does not fail the
#     checkout.
#   - Always exits 0 so `git worktree add` is never reported as failed.
